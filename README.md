# NLP for Disaster Tweets Classifier

A machine learning solution for the [Kaggle Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) competition. This project aims to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Twitter has become an important communication channel during emergency events. However, it's not always clear whether a person's words are actually announcing a disaster or just using disaster-related keywords metaphorically. This project builds a machine learning model to predict which tweets are about real disasters.
